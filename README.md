This repo contains the source code for a simple CRUD application, written in Java. The application uses the [JDBC](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/) to connect to and communicate with an existing [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/) cluster.

For instructions on starting CockroachDB and running the code, see [this tutorial](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-java-app-with-cockroachdb.html).
